# CareerCraft – A Simple Career Assistance Website
Made by "Guruhari"

CareerCraft is a small web application I built for my college mini project.  
The goal of this project is to help students quickly check and improve their resume, find important job keywords, practice interview questions, and generate profile/portfolio text without using any backend or database.  
Everything is done using only **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.


Why I built this
I wanted to create something simple, useful and easy to use for students who are preparing for placements or internships.  
Most tools online are complicated or require login, so I made a clean and fast website that anyone can use.


What the website can do:

1. Resume Analyzer  
You can paste your resume text and the tool gives:  
- A simple score  
- Missing sections  
- Word count  
- Basic suggestions  

2. Job Keyword Finder  
If you type a job title (like “software engineer”), it shows:  
- Technical skills  
- Tools used  
- Soft skills  
These keywords help in improving ATS ranking.

3. Interview Trainer  
This tool gives random HR, Technical and Behavioral questions.  
You can:  
- Get new questions  
- Add questions to favorites  
- Give yourself a quick rating  

4. Profile Enhancer  
This section helps you quickly generate:  
- LinkedIn headline  
- About Me summary  
- Skills section  
Useful for resumes and online profiles.


About this project
- Built using **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**  
- No frameworks or database used

I tried to keep the design clean, minimal and easy to understand.
